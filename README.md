## How It's Made:
This is web application that accesses an Express API. The frontend uses fetch to retrieve the data from the API.

This is part of the self-paced software engineering I am completing: [#100devs](https://100devs.org/about).

### Tech Used:
- Javascript

## Optimizations
It needs more birds. I will be learning more MongoDB soon so instead of manually entering the data into an API, I will store the data in a database but will likely leave this API live for reference to an API built with a static object.

## Lessons Learned
I learned about
